/**
 * Description:
 * The VelocityClosedLoop_AuxStraightIntegratedSensor example demonstrates the new Talon/Victor auxiliary
 * and remote features used to peform complex closed loops. This example has the robot performing 
 * Velocity closed loop with an auxiliary closed loop on integrated sensor difference (Heading)
 * to keep the robot straight.
 * 
 * This example uses:
 * - 2x Falcon 500 Integrated Sensors, one on both sides of robot for Primary Closed Loop on Velocity
 * A Talon/Victor calculates the distance by taking the sum of both sensors and dividing it by 2.
 * - 2x Falcon 500 Integrated Sensors, one of both side of robot for Auxiliary Closed Loop on Heading
 * A Talon/Victor calculates the heading by taking the difference between both sensors.
 * 
 * This example has two modes of operation, which can be switched between with Button 2.
 * 1.) Arcade Drive
 * 2.) Velocity Closed Loop with integrated sensor and drive straight with integrated
 * sensors difference
 * 
 * Controls:
 * Button 1: When pressed, zero all sensors. Set integrated sensor' positions to 0.
 * Button 2: When pressed, toggle between Arcade Drive and Velocity Closed Loop.
 * 	When toggling into Velocity Closed Loop, the current heading is saved and used
 * 	as the the auxiliary closed loop target. Can be changed by toggling out and in again.
 * Left Joystick Y-Axis: 
 * 	+ Arcade Drive: Drive robot forward and reverse
 * 	+ Velocity Closed Loop: Servo robot forward and reverse [-500, 500] RPM
 * Right Joystick X-Axis:
 * 	+ Arcade Drive: Turn robot left and right
 * 	+ Velocity Closed Loop: Not used
 * 
 * Gains for Velocity Closed Loop and Auxiliary may need to be adjusted in Constants.java
 * 
 * Supported Version:
 * - Talon FX: 20.2.3.0
